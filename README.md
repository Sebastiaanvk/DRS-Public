# README Project

This repository consists of three folders:

- cleanCode: This is a cleaned up version of the finalExperimentsForThesis folder. This code is intended to be used for further experiments and analysis. Some less important functionality has been removed, such as the specific way the experiments were run and how the data sets were generated.
- finalExperimentsForThesis: This contains the code and algorithm implementations that I used for the results in the thesis report and the presentation. It is not cleaned up in its current form. It contains all the algorithm implementations, the graph and data sets generation methods, sfml code to visualize the problem instances and solutions, data sets and results (these are in the zip file in releases) and python code to analyse the results and produce plots. 
- oldCode: This folder contains all the code that I wrote during the whole thesis project. Some of the code in the folders does not compile and some does work, but I ended up not using it for the thesis report or presentations. 

The final data sets and results for the thesis can be found in the zip file in releases.
