## allNightVariableEdges

450 graphs. Ran for one night.

Ran on all heuristic algorithms.

Generated using the double graph method with degrees for the section. Taken uniformly random from the parameter ranges. Most parameters were fixed though. We added and extra parameter: goalEdges. This parameter scales the degree so the total number of edges is kind of similar to the goalEdges. Five graphs per parameter.

- nodes: 800
- layers: 6
- oddsSet1: 0.25 
- degree1: 1,12
- degree2: 1,9
- degreeCross: 0.6,4 
- goalEdges: 1000,10000
- weight1: 1000 uniformly, with 0.5 coinflip
- weight2: 100 uniformly, with 0.5 coinflip
- minLayerRatio: 0.80 


    expectedEdges = ((nrLayers-1)/nrLayers)\* nrNodes*(0.25\*edgeDegree1+0.75\*edgeDegree2 + pars.edgeDegreeCross);
    degreeScalingFactor = goalEdges(gen)/expectedEdges;
    
    Then all the degrees get scaled by this scaling factor


Plot conclusion: Bit meh, the edges ended up not being spread uniformly.

## AllNightVariableEdgesNew

2765 graphs. Ran for one night.

Ran on all heuristic algorithms.

Generated by creating graphs with the exact number of edges as goalEdges, take uniformly from a range. The other parameters are fixed. Furthermore, the graph is split into two groups, which do not affect the edges but they do affect the weight functions.

- nodes: 600
- layers: 5
- oddsSet1: 0.25 
- goalEdges: 500,6000
- weight1: 1000 uniformly, with 0.5 coinflip
- weight2: 100 uniformly, with 0.5 coinflip
- minLayerRatio: 0.80 
- graphsPerPars: 5


Plot conclusion: Works really well for showing the influence of the edges I think.


## AllNightVariableNodes

1990 graphs. Ran for one night.

Ran on all heuristic algorithms.

Generated by creating graphs with the number of nodes taken uniformly from a range. The other parameters are fixed. Furthermore, the graph is split into two groups, which do not affect the edges but they do affect the weight functions.

- nodes: 200,2000
- layers: 5
- nrEdges: 2500
- oddsSet1: 0.25 
- weight1: 1000 uniformly, with 0.5 coinflip
- weight2: 100 uniformly, with 0.5 coinflip
- minLayerRatio: 0.80 
- graphsPerPars: 5


Plot conclusion: Great for showing how the times of the algorithms scale with the number of nodes, but the density gets so low, that single path gives a very high objective value.


## AllNightVariableLayers

1780 graphs. Ran for one night.

Ran on all heuristic algorithms.

Generated by creating graphs with the number of layers taken uniformly from a range. The other parameters are fixed. Furthermore, the graph is split into two groups, which do not affect the edges but they do affect the weight functions.

- nodes: 450
- layers: 3,25
- nrEdges: 3000
- oddsSet1: 0.25 
- weight1: 1000 uniformly, with 0.5 coinflip
- weight2: 100 uniformly, with 0.5 coinflip
- minLayerRatio: 0.80 
- graphsPerPars: 5


Plot conclusion: Absolutely great!


## allNightAllAlgorithmsFast
1640 graphs. Ran for one night.

Most parameters are taken from a range. Graphs are generated using the double uniform method for the weight functions.

- nodes: 100,300
- layers: 3,10
- nrEdges: 200-1500
- oddsSet1: 0.15,0.25 
- weight1: 1000 uniformly, with 0.5 coinflip
- weight2: 100 uniformly, with 0.5 coinflip
- minLayerRatio: 0.80 
- graphsPerPars: 5


Plot conclusion: Fine for showing the solution quality compared to the exact values and showing the scaling of the gurobi functions
