Currently just a copy of comparing_algorithms
I want to test out some graph generating methods.
See how they fare and whether they are fast
Preferably, I want to make an interface so that I can add the generators to functions that compare algorithms and generate graphs.
Either that or I just want to save the graphs to a file so I can reuse them.
