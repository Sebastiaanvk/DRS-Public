# README Clean Code

This is the cleaned up version of the finalExperimentsForThesis.    

Many files and lines of codes have been removed.

The folder contains all the relevant algorithm implementations. The implementations have their own .h and .cpp files, but can be called using the algorithmWrappers files.

The graphGeneration files only contain the functions for generating single graph instances. The functions for generating the data sets and running the experiments can be found in the graphGeneration and experiments files in the finalExperimentsForThesis folder.

The python folder contains a file with useful functions for reading and analyzing the results of the experiments.

The code can be compiled by running the MakeFile, but the paths will need to be adjusted and the dependencies are required. The dependencies are for SFMl and for Gurobi.
